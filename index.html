<div class = "paragraph_description">
    <p>
        At Martin's Mill, we strive to focus our times of
        worship together on discipleship and spiritual
        refreshment. Through Scripture study, prayer,
        fellowship, and music, we encourage one another to serve
        the Lord throughout the week. We believe that meeting
        with one another on a frequent basis equips us to
        serve the Lord fully in our homes, workplaces,
        and communities (Heb. 10:25).

        <span style = "font-family: mmbcLogoFont; color: #2E0854;">SUNDAY MORNING WORSHIP</span><br/>
        Our worship team begins the service with a time of praise. We sing a variety of music ranging in style from traditional hymns to contemporary songs. After we sing together, Pastor Matt delivers a message from Scripture. We then wrap up with some songs and general announcements.    
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style = "font-family: mmbcLogoFont; color: #2E0854;">SUNDAY EVENING WORSHIP</span><br/>
        This evening worship time is centered around fellowship and Scripture study. We all meet in the fellowship hall for a snacky, potluck-style dinner together. After we get the chance to eat and visit with each other, we all gather around tables and pick out hymns to sing together. Normally, Pastor Matt shares a message from Scripture, but we often will hear personal testimonies or mission trip reports during this time.

        We have a simple Sunday school system. We currently have four classes available:
        <ul>
            <li>Adult - The dynamic of this class is fun to see because of the wide variety of people who attend. College-age singles, married couples, and senior citizens all enjoy the wisdom and humor that the other ages have to offer. </li>
            <li>Youth - The youth enjoy a time of discussion and fellowship. Ages range from high school freshmen to high school seniors. Both public and homeschool groups are represented. </li>
            <li>Children - Our dedicated teachers make Sunday school a joy for the kids. With hands-on projects and a focus on Scriptural teaching, we hope to encourage a love for truth.</li>
            <li>Nursery - The nursery is available for infants to 4 years.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style = "font-family: mmbcLogoFont; color: #2E0854;">WEDNESDAY EVENING HOME GROUP</span><br/>
        Each Wednesday, we have a small group meeting at a member's house. We all bring part of the meal,
        then we eat and fellowship together before starting a study on a book of the Bible. Childcare is provided.
        We are currently studying 1 John.

    <div class = "paragraph_description" style = "width: 700px;">
        We believe that humanity is sinful and therefore has lost fellowship with God. Because, according to Scripture, we are not able to
        make up for this loss by our own effort or merit, God sent His only beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth to atone for our sins and restore
        our relationship with God. We believe the only proper response to such a gracious and incredible love is to turn away from our sins and fully
        surrender to Jesus as our Lord and Savior. While we, as Christians, will inevitably sin and fall short of God's glory, we believe that individual
        Christians and the church should strive for holiness and obedience to the Bible's teaching.<br/><br/> For a full version of our faith statement, click <a href = "TheBaptistFaithAndMessage.pdf" target = "_blank" style = "text-decoration: none; color: #11E;">here.</a>
