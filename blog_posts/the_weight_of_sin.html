                <p>
                    Many people operate today within the concept that the weight of sin rests in the perceived severity of the sin.  We classify some sins as "Minor" and some as "Major".  We tell "Little White Lies" as if they aren't to be scorned like "real", major lies.  Through this complicated web of understanding, we have allowed ourselves to justify actions that are sin, but we don't feel so bad about it because they "aren't that bad".
                </p>
                <p>
                    This outlook is a basic flaw in how we view things.  You see, the weight of sin lies not in the severity of sin, but in the Holiness and Purity of the One against whom we have sinned.  This is not to say that the severity of consequence doesn't vary, or even the depth of impact.  This also doesn't diminish the abhorrent nature of some sins versus others.  The danger comes in believing somehow that God is strangely less offended by our everyday sin.  Even the "smallest" sin, is of the highest offense to a Holy God.  Let us persevere and strive for Holiness.
